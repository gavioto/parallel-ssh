PSSH provides parallel versions of OpenSSH and related tools.  Included are pssh, pscp, prsync, pnuke, and pslurp.  The project includes psshlib which can be used within custom applications.  The source code is written in Python and can be cloned from:

git clone http://code.google.com/p/parallel-ssh/

PSSH is supported on Python 2.4 and greater (including Python 3.1 and
greater). It was originally written and maintained by Brent N. Chun.  Due to his busy schedule, Brent handed over maintenance to Andrew McNabb in October 2009.
